gLaTeX
======

NOTE: There's a far better Google Docs plugin available now, which I recommend using instead of gLaTeX. See https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmath/hhaencnpmaacoojogjkobikbmkhikjmm?utm_source=permalink for more information.


Script allowing LaTeX formulas in Google Docs. Uses the service at http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php to generate images from LaTeX code.

This is very much work in progress. Code is made public at https://github.com/Itangalo/gLaTeX just to allow others to read and maybe improve it.
