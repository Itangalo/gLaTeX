gLaTeX
======

Script allowing LaTeX formulas in Google Docs. Uses the service at http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php to generate images from LaTeX code.

This is very much work in progress. Code is made public at https://github.com/Itangalo/gLaTeX just to allow others to read and maybe improve it.
